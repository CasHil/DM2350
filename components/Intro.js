    <p>
      Thank you for participating in our study about perceptual preferences in
      jazz! Our goal in this research is to find out the preferences of
      listeners, varying specific aspects (tempo, swing ratio and delays of the
      soloist) of the song that you will be listening to. It will take you about{" "}
      <b>10 minutes</b>. First you will be asked for some statistics about
      yourself. After that, you will listen to 25 samples, which you will have
      to rate how much you like or dislike them and how groovy you think they
      are. All of the samples are adapted from one piece of jazz. Make sure that
      you listen to the samples with headphones in and in a quiet environment.
      Please use either <b>Chrome</b> or <b>Safari</b> to ensure that the
      website works correctly. <br /> All your data is completely anonymous and
      will be stored only for the duration of the course, after which it will be
      discarded.
