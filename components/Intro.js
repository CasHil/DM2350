    <p>
      Thank you for participating in our study about perceptual preferences in
      jazz! Our goal in this research is to find out the preferences of
      listeners, varying specific aspects (tempo, swing ratio and delays of the
      soloist) of the song that you will be listening to. It will take you about{" "}
      <b>10 minutes</b>. First you will be asked for some statistics about
      yourself. After that, you will listen to 25 samples, which you will have
      to rate on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means liking it the least and 5
      means liking it the most. Similarly, you will be asked how groovy you find
      the sample. All of the samples are adapted from one piece of jazz. Make
      sure that you listen to the samples with headphones in and in a quiet
      environment. <br /> Note: All your data is completely anonymous and will
      be stored only for the duration of the course, after which it will be
      discarded.
